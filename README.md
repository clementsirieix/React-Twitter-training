Look up the Twitter trends regarding your location.

A training I did using **React**(15.3), **Redux**, **D3.js**, **Webpack** and the Twitter API.

## Running
To test the app locally, you will need to register your own app through [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/), then update the src/server/configApi.js file.
You will need NPM, Nodemon and Webpack.
```
    npm install
    npm start
```
